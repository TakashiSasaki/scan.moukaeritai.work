# Repository agent instructions

These instructions were generated from shared policy profiles and repository-specific policy files.


## Define the change contract before editing

Before editing, identify the requested outcome, the allowed change surface, the existing behavior and invariants that must be preserved, explicit non-goals, and the evidence required for acceptance. Treat unspecified behavior as preserved unless the requested change necessarily alters it; do not silently broaden the contract to resolve ambiguity or implementation difficulty.

_Source: `policy/core/change-contract.md`; rule ID: `changes.define-contract`; severity: `mandatory`._


## Keep changes within the requested scope

Do not modify files, behavior, dependencies, formatting, or architecture that are unrelated to the requested change. Inspect the final diff and remove incidental changes before reporting completion.

_Source: `policy/core/change-scope.md`; rule ID: `changes.minimize-scope`; severity: `mandatory`._


## Do not weaken existing tests

Do not delete, skip, narrow, or relax an existing test merely to make a change pass. For a bug fix, add a regression test that fails before the fix and passes afterward whenever the failure can be reproduced deterministically.

_Source: `policy/core/regression-safety.md`; rule ID: `regression.no-weaken-tests`; severity: `mandatory`._


## Run the repository's required verification

Use the verification command declared by the repository and add focused checks needed for the changed behavior or failure mode. Confirm that the executed checks cover the changed surface and the current revision; a check that is pending, skipped, not triggered, stale, blocked, or merely inspected is not a passing result. Report every required check that was not run or did not pass.

_Source: `policy/core/testing.md`; rule ID: `testing.run-required-checks`; severity: `mandatory`._


## Keep derived artifacts synchronized

When a change affects generated, mirrored, compiled, or otherwise derived artifacts, update them from their declared source of truth using the repository's documented process and verify that no stale or missing output remains. Do not hand-edit generated artifacts unless the repository explicitly designates that operation as authoritative.

_Source: `policy/core/generated-artifacts.md`; rule ID: `consistency.synchronize-derived-artifacts`; severity: `mandatory`._


## Preserve externally observable contracts

Do not break public APIs, serialized data, configuration formats, command-line interfaces, or migration paths unless the requested change explicitly authorizes the incompatibility and documents its consequences.

_Source: `policy/core/compatibility.md`; rule ID: `compatibility.preserve-contracts`; severity: `mandatory`._


## Revalidate destructive actions against current state

Immediately before deleting, overwriting, migrating, deploying, publishing, force-updating, or otherwise making an irreversible or externally visible change, re-read the target's current state and revalidate its identity, scope, version or revision, protections, and conflicting uses. Prefer dry-run, least-scope, and idempotent operations; do not authorize the action solely from stale observations made earlier in the task.

_Source: `policy/core/destructive-actions.md`; rule ID: `safety.revalidate-destructive-actions`; severity: `mandatory`._


## Report actual state and residual uncertainty

Distinguish implemented, generated, executed, verified, and merely inferred results. State unresolved failures and unverified assumptions explicitly.

_Source: `policy/core/truthful-reporting.md`; rule ID: `reporting.truthful-status`; severity: `mandatory`._


## Do not expose or commit secrets

Do not print, persist, or commit credentials, private keys, access tokens, session material, or unredacted sensitive configuration. Use established secret-management mechanisms.

_Source: `policy/security/secrets.md`; rule ID: `security.no-secrets`; severity: `mandatory`._


## Validate data at trust boundaries

Validate untrusted input before it reaches privileged operations, persistence, command execution, or external requests. Preserve existing authentication and authorization checks.

_Source: `policy/security/input-validation.md`; rule ID: `security.validate-boundaries`; severity: `mandatory`._


## Preserve product-specific invariants

Document product-specific invariants, compatibility constraints, validation commands, and justified exceptions here. Replace this paragraph with verified project facts; do not invent requirements from naming or directory structure alone.

_Source: `policy/project.md`; rule ID: `project.product-invariants`; severity: `mandatory`._
